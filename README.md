##  Minimum System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| CPU       | 4 Cores     |
| RAM       | 4 GB        |

##  Prepare This Before Installation

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| âœ… VPS | Linux VPS (Ubuntu 20.04 or newer) |
| âœ… Terminal Access | Basic command-line knowledge |
| âœ… Accounts | Discord, Telegram, and X (Twitter) |
| âœ… Dashboard | Registered on Datagram Dashboard |
| âœ… API Key | Get from Wallet > Licenses tab |


## PRE-REQUISITES

Make sure youâ€™ve got these installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git wget curl -y
```
Download and make the CLI executable:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Datagram-Group/datagram-cli-release/releases/latest/download/datagram-cli-x86_64-linux && \
sudo mv datagram-cli-x86_64-linux /usr/local/bin/datagram-cli && \
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/datagram-cli
```

## Run the Node

First, create a screen session using the following command. This ensures your node keeps running even if you close the terminal:

```bash
screen -S datagram
```

```bash
datagram-cli run -- -key ENTER_API_KEY
```

Replace `ENTER_API_KEY` with the actual key you got from Datagram.

### Now, open the Datagram Dashboard and:

- Go to the Wallet section.

- Click on the Licenses tab (next to "Main").

- Copy your API Key from there.

Then run the following command (make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual key you just copied):

### If everything works, youâ€™ll see output like:

```bash
