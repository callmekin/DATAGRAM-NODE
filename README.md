##  Minimum System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| CPU       | 4 Cores     |
| RAM       | 4 GB        |

##  Prepare This Before Installation

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ VPS | Linux VPS (Ubuntu 20.04 or newer) |
| ‚úÖ Terminal Access | Basic command-line knowledge |
| ‚úÖ Accounts | Discord, Telegram, and X (Twitter) |
| ‚úÖ Dashboard | Registered on Datagram Dashboard |
| ‚úÖ API Key | Get from Wallet > Licenses tab |


## PRE-REQUISITES

Make sure you‚Äôve got these installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git wget curl -y
```
Download and make the CLI executable:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Datagram-Group/datagram-cli-release/releases/latest/download/datagram-cli-x86_64-linux && \
sudo mv datagram-cli-x86_64-linux /usr/local/bin/datagram-cli && \
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/datagram-cli
```

## Run the Node

First, create a screen session using the following command. This ensures your node keeps running even if you close the terminal:

```bash
screen -S datagram
```

```bash
datagram-cli run -- -key ENTER_API_KEY
```

Replace `ENTER_API_KEY` with the actual key you got from Datagram.

### Now, open the Datagram Dashboard and:

- Go to the Wallet section.

- Click on the Licenses tab (next to "Main").

- Copy your API Key from there.

Then run the following command (make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with the actual key you just copied):

### If everything works, you‚Äôll see output like:

```bash
App version: 1.1.x
Downloading...
Worker version: 1.1.x
INFO: Downloaded 100.00%
Run...
34527
```

To detach from the screen (without stopping the process): Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`

## View Node Logs

To reattach the screen and view live node logs:

```bash
screen -r datagram
```

To detach from the screen (without stopping the process): Press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`


## Confirm Participation

Make sure to fill out the **Early Alpha Form** using your **X (Twitter)** and **Discord** information to officially participate in the Datagram Network Alpha.

Your node will **start earning points after 4~6 hours** of continuous uptime. For **maximum rewards**, keep your node running **24/7** without interruptions.



## üõ† Common Errors & Fixes

### ‚ùå Error: datagram-cli: command not found
Fix: You probably forgot to move the binary or named it incorrectly. Re-run:

```bash
chmod +x datagram
mv datagram /usr/local/bin/datagram-cli
```

Then check:

```bash
datagram-cli --help
```

### ‚ùå Error: invalid cross-device link during binary download

```bash
panic: rename /tmp/download-xxxxx.tmp /root/.datagram/...
invalid cross-device link
```

Fix: This happens when /tmp and /root are on different disk volumes.

Solution: Run the node manually first once (outside of screen), let it complete the download and setup:

```bash
datagram-cli run -- -key ENTER_API_KEY
```

### ‚ùå Error: Nothing happens after running in screen

Fix: Make sure your full command looks like this:

```BASH
screen -S datagram
```

Then inside:

```BASH
datagram-cli run -- -key ENTER_API_KEY
```

Do not use screen -dmS unless you're 100% sure it's running in background correctly and logging somewhere.
